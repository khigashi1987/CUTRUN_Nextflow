# CUTRUN_Nextflow
CUT&amp;RUN-seq analysis pipeline built using Nextflow.

Short-read trimming and alignment processes are based on the following paper:
[Zhu, Q., Liu, N., Orkin, S.H. et al. CUT&RUNTools: a flexible pipeline for CUT&RUN processing and footprint analysis. Genome Biol 20, 192 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1802-4](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1802-4)

MACS2 and [SEACR](https://github.com/FredHutch/SEACR) can be used to call peaks.
